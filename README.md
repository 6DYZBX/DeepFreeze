This is a release version of the original dev version of DeepFreeze by scottpalladin

I have picked up and expanded extensively to this version. The original license allows for Sharing
and Adaption. As per the terms of the original license full credit to scottpalladin PalladinLabs 
for the original concept, ideas and dev mod.
This version will be known as
"DeepFreeze Continued..."

This mod provides the ability to freeze and thaw kerbals for those long space journeys.
Introduces glykerol resource used for freezing kerbals.
To freeze a kerbal you must have 5 glykerol units and 3000 electrical charge per kerbal.

Uses:
=====
When kerbals are frozen they do not consume life support resources (known issue with TACLS see below).
If you don't use life support mods, this mod doesn't really do much, except provide a few cool parts
and feature that doesn't do much.

Features:
=========
Large 2.5M CRY-2300 DeepFreezer for up to 10 kerbals. (with WIP internals). 
Has on-board Glykerol tank which can store up to 40 units of Glykerol.
RS-X20R radial glykerol tank for up to 20 units of extra glykerol storage.
Full featured GUI allowing you to see all frozen kerbals and freeze/thaw kerbals. 
(kerbals can also be frozen/thawed via part right click menu).
Provides monitoring capability of frozen kerbals at a cost of Electrical Charge. 
WARNING!! - use of this feature means kerbals will die if you run out of electrical charge. 
To use this feature you must change the config file settings as the default for this feature is off.
Full integration and support of Ship Manifest mod by Papa_Joe.
Module Manager config file included for support of CLS mod supported by Papa_Joe.
